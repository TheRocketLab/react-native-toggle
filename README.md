# rktlab-react-native-toggle

A custom React Native toggle component

## Installation

```sh
npm install rktlab-react-native-toggle
```
or

```sh
yarn add rktlab-react-native-toggle
```

## Usage

To use this toggle component, import the toggle component into your React Native project

The toggle has two required properties, they are:

- `onValueChange`: Callback called when the toggle is pressed.
- `value`: Boolean to set the initial value of the toggle.

```js
import Toggle from 'rktlab-react-native-toggle';

export deafult function App(){
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false);
  const onValueChange = (value: boolean) => setActive(value);

  return (
    <Toggle onValueChange={onValueChange} value={active} />
  )
}
```
## Table of Contents

| Properties        | Type        | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| onValueChange     | _function_  | Callback called when the toggle is pressed.|
| value             | _boolean_   | The value of the toggle. If true the toggle will be turned on.|

| onIcon            | _ReactNode_ | Pass a component to be rendered inside the toggles circle, example: onIcon={`<Text> âœ“ </Text>`}|
| labels            | _string[]_  | The label or labels of the toggle, this is passed as an array, if you have a label type of `both` you can have two labels|
| labelType         | _string_    | This is the type of label. You can choose from these options: `'top' 'left' 'right' 'both'` |
| disabled          | _boolean_   | If passed the component will be set to a disabled state|
| styleType         | _string_    | So far you can choose from two types of styles, `Material` or `Stock`, if you do not choose a type, it will default to Material|
| customTrackColor  | _object_    | This allows you to choose a custom style outside of the default styles for the toggle track bar.|
| customCircleColor | _object_    | This allows you to choose a custom style outside of the default styles for the switch thumb.|

## Custom Fonts

Our Toggle component supports the usage of custom fonts. To apply a custom font, you will need to pass the font family name to the customFont prop of the Toggle component.

```jsx
<Toggle
  ...
  customFont='Your-Custom-Font-Name'
/>
```

Please note, the customFont prop accepts a string that should exactly match the name of the font that you've imported into your project. Font names often include spaces and are case sensitive.

Remember, our Toggle component does not ship with any font files due to licensing restrictions, so it's the user's responsibility to handle the importing and linking of any font files they wish to use.

# Examples:
